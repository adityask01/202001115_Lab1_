Q2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.


Scope


	There are around 466 million individuals, or almost 5% of the world's population, who are affected by hearing loss that is incapacitating. We set out to develop a useful solution for this group that takes care of some of their basic requirements. Using artificial intelligence, we create a mobile application that recognizes important sound events that are of relevance to this group, such as traffic horns and babies, where users need quick warnings and continual logging. This software is designed for Android and has low latency so that it may be used in real time and notify the user of the event.


Features


The application should be able to detect key sound events that are relevant to the users.

The application should notify the user of the event.

The application should be optimized for android.


Non Functional Aspects


The alerts to the user should be immediate.

The user must be logged in all the time.

The application should be low-latency.

The application should work in real-time to notify user of sudden events.
